# Eigenvalue-Algorithm-Performance

Making use of numpy, eigenvalue.py creates a random 5x5 matrix and tests the performance of an algorithm in determining the largest eigenvalue of the random matrix at various tolerance levels.

I then make use of matplotlib using a logarithmic scale on the x-axis to plot the performance of the algorithm and save the resulting plot as 'iterations.png'.
